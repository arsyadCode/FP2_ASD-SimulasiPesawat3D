# FP2_ASD-SimulasiPesawat3D

Run file 'hasil.exe'

## Instruction Gameplay

When you run the gameplay, please keep in mind, you just need to press the button

- W: Forward
- S: Backward
- Space: Shoot
- Drag Mouse to orient the plane

If you press another button that was mentioned before, the terrain will probably disappear.

## Any something wrong/error when running the file?

Unzip 'gamebyNezha.zip', extract it to another/new folder, then run 'hasil.exe'

Enjoy the simulation game :wink:
